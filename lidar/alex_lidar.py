"""
This module wraps the pyrplidar library to provide functions to connect to and disconnect from a RPLidar device,
as well as process incoming scan data. It builds a wrapper around the PyRPlidar library, and implements enough functionality to connect to the device, start a scan, and process the incoming data. More advanced functionality can be added as needed. Refer to the PyRPlidar library to see what other functionality is available.

Refer to the alex_example_lidar.py file for an example of how to use these functions.


Functions:
    lidarConnect(port: str = PORT, baudrate: int = BAUDRATE, wait: int = 2) -> PyRPlidar:
        Connects to the RPLidar device, resets it, and sets the motor PWM.
    lidarDisconnect(lidar: PyRPlidar):
        Stops the RPLidar device, sets the motor PWM to 0, and disconnects it.
    process_scan(incomingScanTuple: tuple, currentRound: dict = {"r": 0, "buff": [], "doScan": False}) -> tuple:
        Processes incoming scan data from the RPLidar device, buffering scans and returning
        complete scan data for 1 full rotation.
Constants:
    PORT (str): The default port to connect to the RPLidar device.
    BAUDRATE (int): The default baud rate for the RPLidar device.

    For example, the lidar might produce 1080 measurements per scan. However, for our purposes, that is too much data. So we group (or Bin) the measurements by angle (i.e., 0-1 degrees, 1-2 degrees) and take the average of the distances in each group.
